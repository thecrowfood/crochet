<h2>I made a crochet pencil case.</h2>
<p>There aren't a lot of commits because I just figured out how to do this, but I have a lot of pictures I will be attaching, one from each thread.  I will also be attaching all of the threads here.  It will go from most recent to least.  Dates may be a little messed up because I can't figure out how to get exact timestamps from the messages.  I'm trying my best to organize it well, though.  </p>

<p> Second of July, 2024 - One session.

  <br>I didn't do a lot during this session and I didn't add anything onto the project.  I was going to add a beaded fringe, but decided against it.
